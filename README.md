## Introduction

[Symphony](https://github.com/b3log/symphony) is a modern community platform, because it:

* implements a content oriented discussion forum
* includes a social network for users to share, make friends, and play games
* the ability to aggregate independent bloggers, to build and share quality resources
* and `100%` open source

Welcome to Sym official community - [HacPai](https://hacpai.com/register?r=88250) for more details.

### Motivation

Sym was born with the following reasons:

(genuine)

* a lot of system interfaces still keep the old style, far from keeping up with the pace of development of the times, they do not have the characteristics of innovation, fun, lack of modern interactive elements and user experience
* most systems are designed from the programmer's point of view, without considering the actual product, operational requirements, such systems function is too simple, the details are not refined enough, the lack of long-term maintenance
* in addition, we are exploring a new community mode, to achieve [Solo](https://github.com/b3log/solo)) and [Symphony](https://github.com/b3log/symphony) combined with [community new experience](https://hacpai.com/b3log)

(funny)

* universal GitHub even can not find a Java community system, Sym to fill the gaps in the universe
* do the most popular open source community system, is expected to be a few years after 82% of the community will be built in Sym
* Ruby/Python/Node.js/(especially) PHP how can do better than Java

## Features

Specific function point details can be viewed at [Sym 功能点脑图](http://naotu.baidu.com/file/cd31354ac9abc047569c73c560a5a913?token=b9750ae13f39ef9a), the following lists the main features of Sym, and illustrates why Sym is **modern**.

The traditional node type community requires the post must belong to a node, the information architecture is top-down. Sym is not a top-down node type information architecture, the post does not require a fixed classification, through the tag to **aggregate** into a domain.

* tag: according to the content of the post intelligent extraction keyword tag automatic completion, a post to multiple tags. The structure of the graph with edge weight is described, which is convenient to calculate the correlation
* domain: a domain contains multiple tags, tags will automatically by post polymerization to specific areas, at any time can increase and decrease the associated tags so as to adjust the scope of the domain, for the final polymerization card list

### To meet the diverse needs of post

![3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/873584/19893288/afc3a74c-a083-11e6-8d1a-356fcb17e94a.png)

* City Broadcast: the recruitment of your city, Meetup, etc.

In addition, all posts can be set **playing area**, it can be placed some "treasure" content, only after the user can enjoy the reward. Play area editor also supports Markdown, Emoji and file upload and other characteristics. Play area to support content updates, and can adjust the value at any time.

For testing posts, you can use the Sandbox mechanism: with the Sandbox tag posts will be considered as a test post, will not show in the home or in a field, will only show in the post of their own posts list.

### Humanized interactive replies

![4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/873584/19893286/afb61794-a083-11e6-80d7-032397e08cc5.gif)

Follow up on the search function to strengthen, to achieve the conditions for filtering, the results highlight, please look forward to.

## Roadmap

### trust system

Through the historical data to carry on the classification to the user, lets the user gradually change to the participant, the organizer, the management, realizes the autonomous community ecosystem.

### badge system

Record the achievements of the users and the contribution to the community.

## Installation

### Requirements

* JDK8
* Maven3+
* MySQL5.5+
* Jetty9 or Tomcat9

### Steps

1. [Download](https://github.com/b3log/symphony/archive/master.zip) source code
2. to modify the database after extracting `src/main/resources/local.properties` configuration, and create a database
3. _may_ need to modify the `latke.properties` port for container port
3. use `mvn install` to build
4. to deploy the war package to the container, the database table will be created automatically at the start of the first

Notice:

* there is no database table SQL script, manual database, table automatically generated in the first boot
* production environment is recommended to use reverse proxy, and the need to configure the WebSocket agent
* Tomcat with more than 9 version, it is best to use the latest version
* reference [Latke 配置剖析](https://hacpai.com/article/1474087427032)

### Configuration

* image upload the default is to upload the server locally, to use [七牛](https://portal.qiniu.com/signup?code=3lewbghpvrqky) can be configured in the `qiniu.*` attribute `symphony.properties`
* mail is sent using [SendCloud](http://sendcloud.sohu.com), you need to configure the `sendcloud.*` attribute in `symphony.properties`

## Feeling

In the implementation of [B3log idea](https://hacpai.com/b3log) of these years:

* we have witnessed the rise and fall of xAE (GAE/BAE/SAE/etc). In 2009 GAE was selected as a server, and began to implement [Latke](https://github.com/b3log/latke) framework to solve the cross platform cloud, until [GAE](https://hacpai.com/article/1443685401909), bid farewell to sigh technical change quickly
* feel the advantages and disadvantages of self-made wheels, and certainly a bit: for a long to product, technology advantages far outweigh the disadvantages of self-made frame
* a playful product or the details of the characteristics of the egg, it needs to be done is a product / feature that can continue to provide user value.
* although until the current B3log product users are not many, but we have a preliminary proof: Java used to achieve the blog, forum, there is nothing bad
* the use of open source software, to understand the idea of open source, into the open source ecology
* [如果你想做个程序员相关的论坛，请三思](https://hacpai.com/article/1471007706462)
